ðŸ§  Universal Super-Resolution (UniSR)

Universal Super-Resolution (UniSR) is a deep learning framework for cross-modality and cross-structure super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.
Unlike conventional models that are restricted to a single imaging modality or biological target, UniSR operates seamlessly across wide-field, confocal, two-photon, SIM, STED, and SMLM data â€” without any optical modification or prior sample information.

Across diverse biological samples and imaging systems, UniSR enhances diffraction-limited data to reveal nanoscale structures, dynamic processes, and organelle interactions with high spatiotemporal fidelity.
